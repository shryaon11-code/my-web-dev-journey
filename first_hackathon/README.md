# 🐸 FrogglePop  

Welcome to **FrogglePop** — my first ever hackathon project! 🚀✨  
This website was created as part of the **HTML-only hackathon** from the Web Development Course by [CoderArmy](https://www.youtube.com/@CoderArmy9).

## 🎯 Project Overview  
The challenge was to build a **multi-page website** using only **HTML** — no CSS, no JavaScript.  
FrogglePop includes all the basics of web development covered in the first 6 lectures of the course.
